# terraform_cashier

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Bjorn248/terraform_cashier)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Bjorn248/terraform_cashier)

Designed to analyze terraform template files and return a cost estimate of running the infrastructure, assuming AWS is the target cloud. Perhaps other clouds can be supported going forward?

This is very much a work-in-progress and is not functional as of yet. Merely using github to save my work for now.
